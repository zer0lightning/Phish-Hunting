Easily Report Phishing and Malware

This is how you can strike back at criminals sending phishing spam - by getting their webpages on blacklists. Blocking their sites helps protect other people and helps researchers trying to stop this. Sites can be blocked within 15 minutes of your report, but you may not immediately see it.
